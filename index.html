<h1>Capercaillie Capers</h1>

<p>Capercaillies are pretty cool birds. It looks like they hang out in woods in Scandanavian places, and they are places that I like hanging out, so it sounds like a great excuse for a holiday/caper!</p>

<p>I first saw one in a David Attenborough programme at my grandparents' house as a kid and thought they were brilliant. Ever since then, I've always wanted to see one in the wild. But, given all I currently know about them is that they don't live locally, this is going to require some planning.</p>

<p>Why am I making a website about this? I wanted to play with Jekyll as a way of storing information, and this particular caper is going to require research. Also, maybe there are others out there who tips on seeing capercaillies in the wild or want to live vicariously through me...?</p>

<p>So, this site will be a blog about my capercaillie capers, that is built with Jekyll. It'll also be where I write up information that I learn about them as I go along.</p>

<p>Here's that video of a capercaillie in the wild, having a go at David Attenborough:</p>
