<h1>Capercaillie Capers</h1>

<p>I've decided that in 2019, I want to go and see a capercaillie in the wild. I worked super hard in 2018, so I wanted to set myself a fun little adventure, and it's been a while since I had a proper holiday. </p>

<p>I really like capercaillies. They're pretty angry, big birds that would probably make a goose back down. I first saw one in a David Attenborough programme at my grandparents' house as a kid, and thought they were brilliant. It looks like they hang out in woods in Scandanavian places, and they are places that I like hanging out too. But, I currently don't know much about them.</p>

<p>Over the years I've found that a good way of learning about stuff is a mixure both studying and also writing up your findings. So, I wanted a way of storing information about planning a trip. I've wanted to use Jekyll for a while and I felt like it might suit this project quite well. I'll keep the blog page updated, and build the rest of the site as I go along.</p>

<p>Here's that video of a capercaillie in the wild, having a go at David Attenborough:</p>
