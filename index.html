<h1>Capercaillie Capers</h1>

<p>Capercaillies are pretty cool birds. It looks like they hang out in woods in Scandanavian places, and they are places that I like hanging out, so it sounds like a great excuse for a holiday. I've always wanted to go see one, but given all I currently know about them is that they don't live locally, that's probably going to require a lot more planning on my part. </p>

<p>Why am I making a website about this? I wanted to play around with Jekyll as a way of storing information, and maybe there's someone else out there who wants to see a capercaillie...? I dunno it feels like a pretty niche thing but who knows. This site is going to be where I store information about these birds, and a blog to document the process of trying to find one in the wild.</p>

<p>Here's a video of a capercaillie in the wild, having a go at David Attenborough:</p>
